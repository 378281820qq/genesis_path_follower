Day 1 CPG: Nov 5 2018

1. Managed to collect two laps of Gurobi Lin/Lat data (pretest OK, 3rd round shut down) at 50Hz
2. Ran 2 sim rounds with Gurobi Lin/Lat at 20 Hz
3. Issue with car again (heat?)
4. trained_weightsPrimalLatTrafo2.mat seems OK, but has offset and trend for left curve


Day 2 CPG: Nov 6 2018

1. trained primal lat network with old upper and lower parameter bounds
2. ran tests (med and fast) with long pNN and lat pNN
3. Trying to get better test results and also working on dual

Day 3: 
1. tried to do primal-dual NN long
2. found large rel duality gap, and also v_ref not well generated
3. ran evening test with 1k and 10k old v_ref long data
4. found that acc only enables above certain speed

Day 4:
1. generate random data based on smoothened v_ref using dv
2. generate 10k data
